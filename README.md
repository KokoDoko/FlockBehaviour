### About the code

- The speed and direction of Fenton and the sheep is calculated [using vector math](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors.html)
- The sheep go slower when Fenton is further by using [inverse proportion](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/directly-inversely-proportional.html)
- Sprites are placed using semantic DOM elements such as `<sheep>`. Use CSS to style the sprite.
- Sprites are animated with [CSS transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/transform) in a Game Loop.
